# CarBookingSystem

This is a simple Car Reservation System. 
This project does not expand into the complexity of cost generation. It is also assumed that when we are booking for multiple date ranges,
the date ranges provided are valid and non-overlapping.



This system also does not handle scenario where multiple request try to book the car at the same time. 
No multithreading issues are handled here.
